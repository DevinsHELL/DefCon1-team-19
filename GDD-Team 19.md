**Game Mechanic:** 

The game mechanic that we are making is an in air dash that allows the player to jump into the air and the dash forward a small distance in order to cross gaps or to traverse over larger obstacles. The dash will be easy to use and not be too complicated to implement. We will bind it to a single keyboard key and will not have any parameters that need to be met before allowing an execution of the dash.

**Outline and objective statement:**

We are planning to make an in air dash mechanic and enhance player mobility in a 2D platformer environment to make sure players can easily cross gaps and traverse obstacles.

**So our key question is :** 

How to make an intuitive and easy to control air dash mechanic that can let players  actions feel fluid and smooth without letting the player feel like it's over complicated and that it breaks the games balance.

**So our goal is:**  
               
            Make a single button dash that can enhance the flow and enjoyment of the platformer while also not reducing the challenge or rhythm of the game.

**Design rationale:**

In terms of in-vision, I think the main thing is to make the dash smooth. As much as this is a rapid prototype we think it should still flow well enough to get the point of the mechanic across. 

The main features are:

* Single key activation  
* Smooth overall feel

Overall the mechanic is a little experimental. Finding what feels best and what we can accomplish within the time frame will be a challenge. 

Also making sure that our github is organized and we are all on the same page while we work is key. 

Dashes have been done in many games and in many forms especially in the 2d platformer space. I think where the innovation comes in is how the dash feels. What separates a bad dash from a good dash, and what separates a good dash from a great dash. So we will try and innovate to make the dash feel as good as possible within the time constraints.

**Developer notes:**

Our individual notes and changes as well as some of our process work

**Devin:** 

Using my premade player controller as a base for the dash. It is kind of floaty but will serve as a good base for the mechanic. It already has ground detection, a jump and standard platformer movement. There are also my other scripts that control timers, end points collision detection ect. 

**Tony:**

**Ideas about Acceleration and deceleration:**   
      
     Do not start and stop the air sprint too abruptly. A little bit of acceleration can be designed and feel like a natural movement, rather than reaching maximum speed immediately.  The same goes for slowing down

**Multi-directional:** 

    For added strategy, we can design not only sprint forward, but also sprint in four or eight directions (up, down, and sideways). This can increase the player's options in jumping and dodging, increasing the depth of the game.

**Sound Design:**

    With a fast, light sound when sprinting, Can consider Marioâ€™s sound effects and make sure sound can let players be happy and relax this feedback can greatly let players enhance it.
